			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>Consolidate all of my various design work into one comprehensive portfolio.</p>
			<!-- change this --> 

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>Potential employers/clients.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>There will be some sort of hover animation on the navigation to indicate which page the user is on. There will be an option on the portfolio page to choose what content the user wants to view (photography, ux/ui, or graphic design). I already have a dynamic gallery for my photography. For the graphic design and the ux/ui, each project will be displayed as a card that the user can click on to view the whole case study.

You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<h3>Typography</h3>

            <h3>About</h3>
			<p>
                Savannah Dobbins is a digital photographer and graphic design student based in Tulsa, Oklahoma. She has seven years of photography experience. Savannah currently studies graphic design at BYU-Idaho through its online program and is working towards her Bachelor&#39;s degree. <br>
        
                Savannah&#39;s work focuses on both natural and urban settings. She feels a close connection to the environment that surrounds her and her goal is to capture its true atmosphere. She has an obsession with light and shadow and finds both to to be incredibly powerful and communicative tools. In her work, she draws on them to bring attention to specific details, to conjure up feelings of peace, wonder, or appreciation in the viewer, and to present the atmosphere of a subject in photographic form. Naturally, she believes shadow is equally as powerful. <br>
        
                If you would like to purchase any of the photographs displayed, are interested in learning more, or are looking to hire, please do get in touch.
